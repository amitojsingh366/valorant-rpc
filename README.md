This is a simple command line program that shows a [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/rich-presence) for VALORANT.
I made this cause i saw a few of my friends trying to fake play VALORANT for whatever reason. So yeah this is for them lol

## How To Run
- Download the compressed binary for your platform from the latest [Release](https://github.com/amitojsingh366/valorant-rpc/releases)
- Extract the binary from the compressed file
- Run the binary from a command line
- Visit [http://localhost:6969](http://localhost:6969)
